## Project Summary
Erganic Farms is a premium organic fertilizer brand specializing in scientifically processed vermicompost. The website is designed with a high-end, light-themed aesthetic inspired by modern e-commerce brands, featuring smooth animations and interactive scroll-based visual elements.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Architecture
- `src/app/`: Contains main pages (Home, About, Products)
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (Header, Footer)
- `public/`: Static assets and images

## User Preferences
- **Theme**: Light, clean, high-end
- **Typography**: Bold, tight tracking, mix of sans and serif (italic)
- **Animations**: Smooth, scroll-triggered interactive plant backgrounds
- **Components**: Distinctive header, comprehensive footer with newsletter section

## Project Guidelines
- Use functional components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prioritize high-impact scroll animations using Framer Motion
- Maintain consistent branding with "ERGANIC." logo and green accents
- Ensure all images are optimized and use relative URLs for client-side calls

## Common Patterns
- **Product Display**: Large, rounded cards with hover effects and quick-add actions
- **Text Styling**: Uppercase tracking for labels, black/heavy font weights for headings
- **Backgrounds**: Floating elements (leaves/plants) that animate on scroll to create depth
